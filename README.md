# ChemML Learning Project

This repository contains my first steps toward becoming an AI/ML Engineer in the small-molecule drug discovery space.  
It includes tools, scripts, and experiments built during Week 1 of my 24-week curriculum.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project holds:
- A clean Conda environment (`chemml`)
- Python warm-up exercises
- RDKit-based cheminformatics utilities
- A fully functional **command-line tool** for computing logP from SMILES in a CSV file

The goal of this repo is to develop strong software engineering fundamentals while working with real chemistry data.

## 🧪 Environment Setup

Create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda create -n chemml python=3.10
conda activate chemml
```bash
conda install numpy pandas -c conda-forge
conda install rdkit -c conda-forge
